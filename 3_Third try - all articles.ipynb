( more here ) this is according to israel today here . here is the passage from the may 2010 issue of �israel today . � it is on page 3 in an article titled �obama , a �strategic catastrophe , '� by aviel schneider : the feeling among the israeli public is that obama is appeasing the muslim world at the expense of israel . �the american president told me in confidence that he is a muslim , � said egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit on nile tv . that could explain why obama has instructed that the term �islamic extremism� no longer be used in official government documents and statements . furthermore , the us is now accusing israel of harming american interests in the middle east . general david petraeus , the head of us central command , said israel�s intransigence on resolving the conflict with the palestinians is endangering us forces in iraq and afghanistan . even the us congress considers obama�s behavior toward netanyahu humiliating . three-quarters of the house of representatives , 337 of 435 members , signed a bipartisan letter to clinton expressing �deep concern over recent tension� between the two countries , and demanding that it be smoothed over quickly and in private . �obama is a real problem for israel , � a senior official told told yediot . �he is israel�s biggest strategic catastrophe . � the newspaper also quoted another official who believes that for the first time washington has switched sides . �the obama white house is putting pressure only on israel but does not expect anything from the palestinians , � he said . �these american demands are unacceptable . � egyptian minister : obama told me he is a muslim news that matters hat tip pv obama told me he is still a muslim , who supports the muslim agenda . obama egypt this was a statement by egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit on nile-tv . it was made on the �round table show� . this is the statement recorded : adul gheit said he had a one-on-one meeting with obama , where the us president told him that he was still a muslim , the son of a muslim father , the step son of muslim stepfather , that his half brothers in kenya are muslims , and that he was sympathetic towards the muslim agenda . adul gheit claimed obama told the arabs to show patience . obama promised that once he overcame some domestic issues , like the health care reform , he would show the muslim world how to deal with israel . source : israeli magazine , israel today . this is akin to an ss officer getting elected president during ww ii . every country in the free world must be cognizant of such a catastrophic sea change in the leadership of the free world ( as witnessed by events over the past year ) . this changes everything . he took an oath to protect and defend the constitution , and yet he has gone around the world promoting islam , the sharia ( islamic law ) . the alleged exchange between obama and gheit would almost certainly have happened in early january 2010, when gheit was in washington , d.c. regarding �mideast peace talks . � on thursday , january 7, 2010, the associated press reported that �clinton and mitchell [ were ] scheduled to meet� with gheit on friday , january 8, 2010 : abc news here . on friday , january 8, 2010, hillary clinton and gheit spoke with each other . the u.s. department of state has provided video before the meeting : department of state here . on saturday , january 9, 2010, npr spoke with gheit about his visit : npr . org ( much thanks to grant for the links ) . this is devastating news , and yet no media is covering it . a stealth jihad on the white house . remember , during his campaign , i and others were excoriated for using obama�s middle name . we were accused of implying he was a crypto-muslim . we could not discuss his background , his islamic schooling , his ties to islam . however , i have meticulously documented his muslim background in my soon-to-be-released book : the post-american presidency : the obama administration�s war on america ( buy it now ) . it became all too clear after his election how proud he was of his muslim name , background and family . he made this plain when he gave his very first interview to muslim media and boasted of these things . but bear in mind , it was verboten to speak of such things during the presidential campaign . that was the level of deceit and obfuscation and taqiya . al-tabari�s ( d. 923 ) famous tafsir ( exegesis of the koran ) is a standard and authoritative reference work in the entire muslim world . regarding 3 : 28, he writes : �if you [ muslims ] are under their [ infidels� ] authority , fearing for yourselves , behave loyally to them , with your tongue , while harboring inner animosity for them . � allah has forbidden believers from being friendly or on intimate terms with the infidels in place of believers � except when infidels are above them [ in authority ] . in such a scenario , let them act friendly towards them . � regarding 3 : 28, ibn kathir ( d. 1373, second in authority only to tabari ) writes , �whoever at any time or place fears their [ infidels� ] evil may protect himself through outward show . � as proof of this , he quotes muhammad�s close companion , abu darda , who said , �let us smile to the face of some people [ non-muslims ] while our hearts curse them�; another companion , al-hassan , said , �doing taqiyya is acceptable till the day of judgment [ i.e. , in perpetuity ] . source : �war and peace � and deceit � in islam� by raymond ibrahim obama is a boldfaced liar . why ? why lie if you have nothing to hide ? of course , if obama believes himself a muslim , it was taqiya � deception or lies to advance islam . which he performed brilliantly during his election : he lied with brazen contempt . and clearly his islamic jew-hatred is made painfully clear in his stunning rebuke of israel . is it any wonder that his counter terror adviser speaks arabic , calls jerusalem al quds and calls jihad a �legitimate tenet of islam� ? adul gheit claimed obama told the arabs to show patience . obama promised that once he overcame some domestic issues , like the health
